EmergeX is designed to efficiently manage and respond to emergency situations—such as accidents, fires, and medical crises—within Dehradun (covering the route from ISBT to Clement Town). The main goal of the project is to develop an intelligent dispatch system that can receive emergency alerts, prioritize them based on severity, and deploy the nearest available response unit (ambulance, fire truck, or police vehicle) through the fastest possible route.
To achieve this, the city’s road network is represented as a weighted graph, where intersections and landmarks act as vertices and roads as edges with travel-time weights. The system employs Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest path between a responder’s current location and the emergency site. A priority queue ensures that higher-severity emergencies are addressed first, while a hash map maintains real-time information about all active units, including their type, location, and availability.
The system continuously updates unit readiness and monitors new incidents, ensuring resources are dynamically allocated with minimal delay. This project demonstrates the practical application of core data structures and algorithms (DSA)—such as graphs, queues, heaps, and hash maps—in solving complex, real-world problems efficiently.
Ultimately, EmergeX aims to minimize response time, enhance coordination among emergency services, and strengthen public safety—serving as a foundational step toward future AI-driven smart city emergency management systems
